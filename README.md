## About

This utility is a CLI front-end for [lib_game_detector](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/lib_game_detector). It is
intended to be used in scripts, especially with picker programs (e.g. `rofi`, `dmenu`, `fzf`,
etc.) in order to launch games, or perform some other action with the game's details.

### Why

I find that searching for games from different sources (e.g. Steam, Heroic, Lutris) is _slow_, as is
just visually searching through a UI. However, detecting games with this tool is _fast_ (~3ms on my machineâ„¢),
as is searching through those games using fuzzy search. This allows me to waste less time _looking_ for what game I
want to play, and more time actually _playing_.

This program in particular is made as a more basic alternative to another project of mine, [rofi-games](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/rofi-games),
making it more universally useful. It is very scriptable and can be used with any picker. Check out
the [extras](./extras) directory for some examples.

### Name

Simply named for the short acronym that isn't used by anything else I'm familiar with: **R**olv's **G**ame **D**etector.

## Usage

![CLI demo GIF](./assets/demo.gif)

#### List the titles and launch commands of all detected games

```sh
rgd list
```

#### List all detected games, showing only their titles

```sh
rgd list --fields="title"
```

#### List all detected games from Steam, along with the paths to their icons

```sh
rgd list --fields="title,path-icon" --source "steam"
```

#### List details for all detected games as prettified JSON

```sh
rgd list --json | jq
```

#### Launch a game selected through `fzf`

```sh
sh -c "$(rgd list | fzf -d $'\t' --with-nth 1 | cut -d$'\t' -f2)"
```

#### Open the root directory for a game with a given title

```sh
rgd get --fields="path-game-dir" "the finals" | xdg-open
```

Note: the matching is case-insensitive

#### Additional information

- Logs are written to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rgd/logs`
- Log level can be changed using the `RUST_LOG` env var, e.g. `RUST_LOG="trace"`

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. If you run into any problems, or have any suggestions/feedback, feel
free to open an issue.

Note, however, that for e.g. support for additional launchers/sources, or game(s) not being
detected, [lib_game_detector](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/lib_game_detector) is the correct
place to open an issue.

### Building

This project is written in Rust, so for contributing features / fixes:

1. Ensure [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed - this project uses the stable toolchain for
   most things, but nightly for the formatting.
2. Make your changes and ensure they work as expected - `cargo run -- your_args_here`.
3. Lint + format + run tests:

    ```rust
    cargo clippy --all -- -W clippy::all && cargo +nightly fmt && cargo test
    ```

I like [just](https://github.com/casey/just), so I keep some utility commands in the [justfile](./justfile).
Check that out for additional checks which are run in the CI.

## Similar programs

- [rofi-games](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/rofi-games): if you use `rofi`, it's worth checking out.
  Additional features include sorting based on access and a full configuration
  file for modifying detected games, or adding fully custom entries to the list.
